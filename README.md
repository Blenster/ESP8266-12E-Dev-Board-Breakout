# ESP8266-12E-Dev-Board-Breakout
KiCAD project to create a simple breakout PCB for use with various ESP8266-12E dev boards.

Designed around this pinout: https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/812vnqUs5tL._AC_SL1500_.jpg

PCB has a few sample LEDs and parts in both through hole and surface mount configurations. The LEDs are on PWM capable pins and the inputs are on non-PWM pins. The circuit is an example circuit and should not be used as it currently is; this is merely a demonstration project to give a good starting point.

NOTE: this is based on a 5V DC project and a TODO item is to change this to 3.3 values.
